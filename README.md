# Web-Scraping

This project involves scraping data using the PRAW API to determine the bodyfats of users from their pictures. The data is scraped from the "guessmybf" subreddit and uploaded to Amaxon's S3 cloud storage service. From the subreddit: the age, gender, name, submission id, bodyfat and URL of the picture are stored in a csv file.
